## ℹ️ info
* About 45 minutes  
* 5 tortillas  

## 📋 ingredients
- [ ] **65	grams**	masa harina
- [ ] **4	grams**	vegetable oil *(1 tsp)*
- [ ] **81	grams**	boiling water, plus warm tap water as needed *(3 oz)*

## 🔪 steps
1. Mix the masa, oil, and water together in a medium bowl with a rubber spatula to form a soft dough. Using your hands, knead the dough in the bowl, adding additional water as needed until the dough is very soft and has the texture of playdough. Cover with a wet towel or plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.
2. Heat griddle with half at medium heat and half at medium high. Cut open seams along both sides of 1 quart or larger ziplock bag, but leave bottom seam intact so bag opens completely.
3. Pinch off a 30 gram piece of dough, and roll into a ball. Place the ball of dough in the middle of ziplock bag, and using 8-inch square baking dish, gently press dough to 1/8-inch-thick tortilla (5 inches in diameter).
4. Unmold uncooked tortilla. Flip tortilla onto right hand and lay on medium side of griddle. After about 30 seconds, edges of tortilla will dry slightly and tortilla will release from griddle. Flip the tortilla over the medium high side and cook until the edges curl and the bottom is spotty brown, 30 to 60 seconds. Flip the tortilla back over and continue to cook until the first side is spotty brown and puffed in places, 30 to 60 seconds *(a gentle press with metal spatula encourages puffing)*. Lay the toasted tortilla between dish towel; repeat with the remaining tortillas.
