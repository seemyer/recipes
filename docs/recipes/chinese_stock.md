<img src="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/chicken-pork-stock-5.jpg" alt="stock" width="320"/>

## info  
* About 200 minutes  
* 6-8 servings  

## ingredients  
```
500 grams	mixed chicken carcasses and parts, such as wings, backs, bones, and feet (1.25 lb)
500 grams	pork neck bones (1.25 lb)
30	grams	sake
3	grams	rice vinegar
2.5	liters	water
4	slices	ginger, smashed
3	stalks	green onion, knotted
5	whole	dried scallops (OPTIONAL, soaked in water at least 2 hours)
Chopped fresh herbs to garnish (cilantro, Thai basil, green onion)
Kosher salt and white pepper
```

## steps  
1. Fill pot with cold water. Add chicken, pork, and sake. Bring to a boil and skim any foam that develops. Add vinegar and continue cooking for 3 minutes.
2. Drain in a colander in the sink, discarding the water, and rinse the chicken and pork well. Roughly rub the meat to get rid of any blood or other impurities. Rinse out the pot.
3. Return the chicken and pork to the pot, cover with 2.5L of water, and bring to a boil. Skim any foam, then add the ginger, green onions, and scallops, if using. Turn down the heat and simmer gently for 2-3 hours, uncovered. Occasionally, skim any foam or fat that develops. In this time, the stock should be reduced by one-third, leaving just under 2L of stock.
4. Strain, reserving the pork and any especially meaty pieces of chicken. If serving immediately, stir in the herbs, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
