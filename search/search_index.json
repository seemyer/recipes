Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl and mix with your hands until mostly homogenous. Combine the water, lemon juice and levain, whisk until combined, then add to the bowl. Form one hand into a stiff claw, and stir with it until no dry flour remains and the dough forms a sticky, shaggy ball. Mix and strengthen the dough for 2-5 minutes, giving a series of slap/folds (pickup one side and fold it over, rotate the bowl and repeat) until it's cohesive and smooths. Cover the dough and place in proofing box at 76\u00b0F.</li> <li>9:15am - 12:45pm. Give the dough 4-5 sets of stretch and folds at 30 minute intervals (9:30am / 9:45am / 10:15am / 10:45am / 11:15am). After the last set, let the dough rest the remainder of bulk fermentation.</li> <li>12:45pm. The dough should have risen in your bowl, smoothed out, and show bubbles on the sides and surface. At the edge of the dough, it should be domed, not flat (indicating the dough needs more time to rise). Lightly flour your work surface and scrape out your dough. Using your bench knife, lightly shape the dough into a round shape. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, uncovered.</li> <li>1:05pm. Flour the work surface, your hands, and the top of the rested dough. Using your bench knife flip the round over onto the floured work surface. Next, take the left edge and fold it over midway to the right. Take the right side and fold it over the left. Take the top edge and fold it down to the middle. Pick up the bottom edge (closest to you) and fold it up over to the top of the dough but keep going until it touches the work surface, flipping everything over so the seams are now on the bottom. Next, using both hands drag the dough down toward your body using your pinky fingers to pinch the dough between your fingers and the work surface. Rotate the dough and continue dragging to create tension on the top and outside of the dough. It's not necessary to excessively tighten this dough (unless it feels fragile and slack to you).</li> <li>1:15pm - 3:45pm. Clean the inside of the medium bowl, dust a dish towel thoroughly on one side with rice flour or bread flour, then line the bowl with the towel, floured-side up. Carefully lift the dough and place it smooth-side up into the towel-lined bowl. Cover the bowl with a large inverted baking sheet, place in proofing box at 76\u00b0F, and allow the dough ball to rise until it roughly doubles in volume and doesn\u2019t spring back readily when you poke it with a fingertip (2 \u2013 4 hours).</li> <li>3:45pm, preheat at 3:00pm. Preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit over the medium bowl, then invert the bowl and baking sheet so that the dough is lying on the sheet. (The sheet will end up inverted.) Lift off the bowl and carefully lift off the kitchen towel. If it sticks at all, be very gentle when coaxing the dough off; the goal is to minimize the loss of gases trapped inside. Score the dough. Splash some water into the inside of a large mixing bowl, then invert it onto the baking sheet over the dough ball. Transfer the whole thing to the oven, reduce oven temperature to 450\u00b0F and bake for 25 minutes. Using oven mitts, remove the bowl and continue baking until the loaf is as dark as you\u2019d like it, 15 to 25 minutes longer. The internal temp should be over 204\u00b0F.

Increase mixer to speed 2 and mix for 5 minutes more. Let dough rest uncovered for 10 minutes. Turn mixer to low speed again and slowly drizzle oil into bowl. When oil is fully incorporated, increase to speed 2 and continue mixing until dough pulls cleanly from the bowl (about 15 minutes).

Every 30 minutes during fermentation, perform a stretch and fold:</p> <p>Dip your hand briefly in a bowl of water, then shake off the excess. Using one hand, scoop your fingers under one side of the dough to the very bottom of the bowl and, working quickly, lift that side, stretch it a few inches, and fold it over to the opposite side.

Lift up the edges of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape. Repeat this stretching until the dough fills the pan, then don't touch it anymore, and let it do its thing.

Using a thin spatula, loosen pizza and peek underneath. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan over a burner and cook on medium heat, moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Immediately sprinkle with grated Parmesan, if using. Transfer pizzas to a cutting board.
